    <h1>Who are we?</h1>
    <p>The Corvallis Food Project serves as a bridge between students and the community in the ongoing fight against hunger. Our goal is to alleviate food insecurity by transporting nonperishable food items from your doorstep to local pantries. This program utilizes door-to-door recruitment to garner attention, before setting out to collect donations on a specific date every term. It is a sustainable and effective way to give back to those in our community- whether you are physically sorting donations in the pantry or setting out bags of food on your porch. </p>
    <h1>What is our mission?</h1>
    <p>To give back to our neighbors in Corvallis, as they continue to embrace students like us with open arms.</p>
    <h1>Meet the executive team!</h1>
